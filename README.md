# FormEZ
FormEZ is a simple React-based SPA that lets users fill and submit a form with fields like name, email, contact, gender, subjects, resume upload, URL, dropdown, and a text area. It uses useState to manage input and logs data to the console on submissionâ€”great for learning React form handling.
